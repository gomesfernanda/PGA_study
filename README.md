# PGA Study

This repo was initially created to play with [PGA - Public Git Archive](https://github.com/src-d/datasets/tree/master/PublicGitArchive/pga) index file.

I decided to run some descriptive statistics on the index file, especially for repos that count with Jupyter Notebooks.

As for now, I decided to run some descriptive statistics also on the repos themselves, examining the [siva files](https://github.com/src-d/go-siva) provided by PGA.

I am following the imaginary steps because I believe they make sense:

- [ ] 1. Get siva files from PGA (following [PGA docs](https://github.com/src-d/datasets/blob/master/PublicGitArchive/pga/README.md))
- [ ] 2. Extract/download siva files (following [go-siva docs](https://github.com/src-d/go-siva))
- [ ] 3. Run queries using gitbase (following [docs.sourced.tech intro](https://docs.sourced.tech/intro/))
